# AI/Machine Learning Intern Challenge: Simple Content-Based Recommendation
***
Thank you for taking the time to review my submission! I really enjoyed this challenge and learned a lot!

## Dataset

I obtained my dataset from The Movie Database (TMDB) API, which includes the most recent movies. I have already saved 300 recent English language movies with their titles and descriptions into the "movies.csv" file. The file is already in the folder, and the Final_code Jupyter notebook contains code to open the file and convert it into a DataFrame, so no extra steps are needed here!

## Setup

Download the GitHub repository (https://github.com/CONNIELIUGH/Lumaa-Intern-Challenge.git) and open it in the terminal. If you don‚Äôt have Jupyter installed, MacBook users can install it using pip install jupyter. Then, type the command "jupyter notebook" or "jupyter-notebook" to open the folder in the Jupyter environment.
Follow the instructions under the ‚ÄúImport Libraries‚Äù section in Final_code.ipynb to download the recommended versions of the required libraries for this project.

‚ùóÔ∏è‚ùóÔ∏èI recommend watching my demo video, which is a bit long but provides clear instructions on downloading libraries and guidance on running the model! üòÑ

## Running
Download my GitHub repository folder, open the folder in the terminal, and type the command "jupyter notebook" or "jupyter-notebook" to launch the Jupyter environment.

## Results
Run the last cell of the Final_code notebook, which executes the function top_5_movies(). (Before running this function, make sure to run the entire notebook to ensure all functions are loaded.)
The function will prompt you for user input‚Äîenter a description of the type of movies you're interested in. It will then provide the Top 5 recommended movies along with their titles and descriptions based on your input!
